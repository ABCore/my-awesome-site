<!--
* If Layer 2 or Layer 3 are active in a level, standing Mario up in a one-tile space with blocks on the same layer both above and below him will cause him to sink slightly into the block, as opposed to being pushed left like normal. Often this will cause him to fall through the ground without the need to jump.

* Walljump: With enough speed, Mario can land on the corners of blocks for a frame - even if they're part of a wall - and jump off of it. As an alternative, this frame can also be used to enter doors or pipes, even if they don't normally have ground.

* It's possible to completely prevent any sprite from spawning so long as the spawn region of the screen can be passed over it (a distance of just over 16 pixels). Because the spawn routine only runs every other frame, this means that you can have up to three frames to do this (the last frame of which can be gotten from pausing the game breifly to realign the frame counter). Two verified methods of doing so are using a rope mechanism to drag Mario during those frame, and using a fast-spinning revolving platform. If moving fast enough, it may also be possible without the use of any sprites. [More info](http://tasvideos.org/forum/viewtopic.php?p=464958#464958)

* The capespin timer isn't cleared inbetween rooms, so capespinning prior to entering a door/pipe will cause Mario to start the next room with a capespin. Normally this isn't very useful, but one advantage is that it applies to even diagonal pipes, which normally don't allow input for a brief period after being fired. Additionally, it can be used to enter and exit pipes while facing the opposite direction you normally would.

<!--
* When Layer 2 or Layer 3 is scrolling and has interaction, the relative Layer 2 position ($7E0026) gets added to capespins to handle interaction with between them. Normally, this resets back to Mario when it goes back to handle sprites and Layer 1, but if the game is frozen (via $9D), this doesn't happen, and the relative position keeps gets added repeatedly. This causes the cape hitbox  axis of Layer 2/3's movement during the freeze, hitting any blocks or sprites along the way. [More information](http://smwc.me/1228582)
